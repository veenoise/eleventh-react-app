# Eleventh React App
This repo is my way of extending my knowledge by using vite instead of the `npx create-react-app react-app-name` (CRA)
## What did I learn?
In this personal activity, I learned how to create a react app using vite with the command `npm create vite@latest`, choosing React -> JavaScript, and doing `cd react-app-name && npm install && npm run dev`. I also extended the functionality of the default page by adding a reset button.
